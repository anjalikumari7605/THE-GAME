    <h1>Hello Gamers</h1> <hr>
    <p>PC gaming is having its golden era right now. New titles are dropping up like candy and previous titles have provided us with stunning gameplay and gripping stories. If you want a good gaming experience, you not only have to get yourself a good PC to do it, but you also need to play the following eight titles. These are the eight PC games you can’t miss out on or you’d be missing out on an adventure of a lifetime.



        #1: Dark Souls 3
        
        
        
        Hardcore fans will tell you Dark Souls 3 is not as hard to play as the two earlier games in the franchise. However, you’ll still end up spending a lot of time defeating the bosses and mobs.

        The game is the best city building game out there by a mile and there are so many things you can do in the game. It allows you to manage anything from the economy to land planning – you can create your own Venice or build a San Francisco styled hillside city. The game also has an active mod community, which allows you to get your hands on custom maps and other such tools to improve the gameplay even further. 
        
        
        
        #5: Doom
        
        
        
        The Doom franchise has been around for a long time and you should play all the games. But the latest edition in the franchise naturally looks the best. It’s also super fun. Now, the game is a gory game with plenty of shooting action. Newer fans might find the multiplayer option more appealing and it is a rather fun way to get together with friends. It’s bloody but so satisfying – no need to think too hard; just go and shoot.
        
        
        
        #6: Overwatch
        
        
        
        Blizzard is rather masterful at making fun games and you could easily include a number of their titles in lists like this. But if you like shooters, you want to play with friends and you are looking for a balance between competitive gameplay and fun, Overwatch is the game for you. The game looks good and it will be something fun and relatively easy to get into at any point.
